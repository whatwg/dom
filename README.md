This repository hosts the [DOM Standard](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/).

### Code of conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Please read and
respect the [WHATWG Code of Conduct](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct).

### Contribution opportunities

Folks notice minor and larger issues with the DOM Standard all the time and we'd love your help
fixing those. Pull requests for typographical and grammar errors are also most welcome.

Issues labeled ["good first bug"](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/labels/good%20first%20bug) are a
good place to get a taste for editing the DOM Standard and providing a pull request.

We'd be happy to mentor you through this process. If you're interested and need help getting
started, leave a comment on the issue or ask around [on IRC](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC).

### Pull requests

See the [whatwg/html README](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/README.md) for the general
guidelines. Note that `source` is `dom.bs` and "Acknowledgements" is "Acknowledgments" here (I
know). Also, the DOM Standard uses [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) to generate
`dom.html`. (Do not worry if using that tool is too complicated, your pull request does not need to
contain the generated HTML.)

### Tests

Tests can be found in the `dom/` directory of
[`w3c/web-platform-tests`](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests).
