This repository hosts the [DOM Standard](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/).

### Code of conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Please read and
respect the [WHATWG Code of Conduct](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct).

### Contribution opportunities

Folks notice minor and larger issues with the DOM Standard all the time and we'd love your help
fixing those. Pull requests for typographical and grammar errors are also most welcome.

Issues labeled ["good first bug"](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/labels/good%20first%20bug) are a
good place to get a taste for editing the DOM Standard and providing a pull request.

We'd be happy to mentor you through this process. If you're interested and need help getting
started, leave a comment on the issue or ask around [on IRC](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC).

### Pull requests

In short, change `dom.bs` and submit your patch, with a
[good commit message](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages). Consider
reading through the [WHATWG FAQ](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ) if you are new here.

Please add your name to the Acknowledgments section in your first pull request, even for trivial
fixes. The names are sorted lexicographically.

If you want to preview the spec locally, you can either use a locally installed copy of
[Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) by running `make` or use the HTTP API version by
running `make remote`.

If you want to do a complete "local deploy" including commit and/or branch snapshots, run
`make deploy`.

#### Formatting

Use a column width of 100 characters.

Do not use newlines inside "inline" elements, even if that means exceeding the column width
requirement.
```html
<p>The
<dfn method for=DOMTokenList lt=remove(tokens)|remove()><code>remove(<var>tokens</var>&hellip;)</code></dfn>
method, when invoked, must run these steps:
```
is okay and
  ```html
<p>The <dfn method for=DOMTokenList
lt=remove(tokens)|remove()><code>remove(<var>tokens</var>&hellip;)</code></dfn> method, when
invoked, must run these steps:
```
is not.

Using newlines between "inline" element tag names and their content is also forbidden. (This
actually alters the content, by adding spaces.) That is
```html
<a>token</a>
```
is fine and
```html
<a>token
</a>
```
is not.

An `<li>` element always has a `<p>` element inside it, unless it's a child of `<ul class=brief>`.

If a "block" element contains a single "block" element, do not put it on a newline.

Do not indent for anything except a new "block" element. For instance
```html
 <li><p>For each <var>token</var> in <var>tokens</var>, in given order, that is not in
 <a>tokens</a>, append <var>token</var> to <a>tokens</a>.
```
is not indented, but
```html
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>For each <var>token</var> in <var>tokens</var>, run these substeps:

  <ol>
   <li><p>If <var>token</var> is the empty string, <a>throw</a> a {{SyntaxError}} exception.
```
is.

End tags may be included (if done consistently) and attributes may be quoted (using double quotes),
though the prevelant theme is to omit end tags and not quote attributes (unless they contain a
space).

### Tests

Tests can be found in the `dom/` directory of
[`web-platform-tests`](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests).
